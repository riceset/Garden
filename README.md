## Introduction

This project utilizes Quartz, a tool enabling the conversion of an Obsidian vault into a static webpage. In my Garden, I will share insights and knowledge gleaned from the fields of Programming and Linguistics.

## About Obsidian

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a powerful knowledge base that works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files.
