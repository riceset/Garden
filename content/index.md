I am a software engineering student at École 42, currently attending the Tokyo campus. I am also a university student at Tokyo University of Foreign Studies (TUFS). In 2021, I completed Harvard University's introduction to Computer Science course, CS50, and had a previous academic stint at 42 São Paulo in Brazil.
